Thank you for showing your happiness for me! I feel supported by you.\r\n(2) I replied, \"I wonder what the weather's like today.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. This makes me feel ignored. Try talking about my good experience.\r\n(3) I replied, \"You're always reading, you need to get a life!\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I feel hurt because I was hoping you would be happy for me instead of upset.\r\n(4) I replied, \"i cant find any good books im so jealous!\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Although you sound jealous, it makes me feel good about reading the book.\r\n(5) I replied, \"i actually finished two really good books\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply.

You make me feel understood and add to my happiness.\r\n(4) I replied, \"are you going to be working more hours now\"\r\nFeedback: Good reply. Asking about my work is good because you express interest in what I say.\r\n(5) I replied, \"Wow, you must be really special.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply.

I know that not having a job can be hard for you, but let's try to acknowledge my difficulty first.\r\n(4) I replied, \"That's great! I'm happy for you!\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. My hardship isn't something to be happy about, so you should try asking me to learn more instead.\r\n(5) I replied, \"im glad to hear your boss is watching over you\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply.

Thank you for showing that you are interested in my cubicle and asking about it.\r\n(3) I replied, \"I miss my cubicle. I had one before too, but I got fired.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. Being fired must've been hard for you, but let's acknowledge my cubicle before talking about yourself.\r\n(4) I replied, \"I wish I had a cubicle all to myself.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply. I understand your wish, but it seems like you're just making the conversation about yourself.\r\n(5) I replied, \"oh my god your cubicle, that everyone else also has, is so amazing and beautiful. breathtaking.\"\r\nFeedback: Bad reply.
